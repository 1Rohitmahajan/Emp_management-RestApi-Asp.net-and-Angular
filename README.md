# Emp_management-RestApi-Asp.net-and-Angular
his project aims to develop a comprehensive Employee Management Website using the .NET framework for the backend and Angular for the frontend, with a RESTful API serving as the communication bridge between them.
Clone the Repository: First, you need to clone the GitHub repository containing your .NET project with Angular front end. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

bash
Copy code
git clone [<repository-url>](https://github.com/1Rohitmahajan/Emp_management-RestApi-Asp.net-and-Angular.git)
Replace <repository-url> with the URL of your GitHub repository.

Navigate to the Project Directory: Once the repository is cloned, navigate into the project directory using the cd command:

bash
Copy code
cd <project-directory>
Replace <project-directory> with the name of your project directory.

Install Dependencies: Your project may have dependencies for both the .NET backend and the Angular frontend. First, let's handle the .NET backend dependencies:

bash
Copy code
cd <backend-directory>
dotnet restore
Replace <backend-directory> with the directory where your .NET backend code resides.

Set Up Angular: If your Angular frontend is in a separate directory, navigate to it and install its dependencies:

bash
Copy code
cd <angular-directory>
npm install
Replace <angular-directory> with the directory where your Angular frontend code resides.

Build Angular Application: After installing Angular dependencies, build your Angular application:

Copy code
ng build
Run the .NET Application: Once everything is set up and dependencies are installed, run your .NET application. Navigate back to the root directory of your .NET project and run:

arduino
Copy code
dotnet run
This command should start your .NET backend server.

Access the Application: Once the .NET server is running, you should be able to access your application by opening a web browser and navigating to the appropriate URL. Usually, the .NET server runs on localhost port 5000 or localhost port 5001 if it's using HTTPS.
